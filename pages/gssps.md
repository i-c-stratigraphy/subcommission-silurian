# GSSPs

The ISSS is doing pioneering work in the area of restudy of previously ratified GSSPs. Recent work has shown that many of the Silurian GSSPs, all of which were ratified in the mid-1980s, have serious deficiencies in terms of their potential use as benchmarks for high-resolution global correlation. 
In 2024 two new GSSPs were ratified by ICS:
- the GSSP for the base of the Aeronian Stage at Hlásná Třebaň (Czech Republic) defined by the FAD of graptolite Demirastrites triangulatus
- the GSSP for the base of the Telychian Stage at El Pintado 1 section (Spain), defined by the FAD of graptolite Spirograptus guerichi

The work on other GSSPs is in progress. Active Working Groups are:

## Pridoli Working Group

The goal is to propose a subdivision of the Pridoli Series into two Stages
Members: Carlo Corradini (Chair), Maria Giovanna Corriga, Neo McAdams, Sigitas Radzevicius, Ladislav Slavik, Andrej Spiridonov and Petr Storch
 

##  Sheinwoodian Working Group
The goal is to find a new GSSP for the base of the Sheinwoodian Stage (= base of the Wenlock Series), to substitute the present inadequate GSSP at Hughley Brook, UK
Members: Brad Cramer (Chair), …
