The International Subcommission on Silurian Stratigraphy (ISSS) is a subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). The objectives of the subcommission are as follows:

1. The development of an internationally agreed scale of chronostratigraphic units, fully defined by GSSPs at Series and Stage levels and related to a hierarchy of units to maximize relative time resolution within the Silurian Period;
2. Establishment of frameworks and mechanisms to encourage international collaboration in understanding the evolution of the Earth during the Silurian Period;
3. Working towards an international policy concerning conservation of geologically important sites.
