### Obituary - Professor ZHANG Wentang (1925-2013) - 2013-10-23

We are saddened to announce that Prof. Zhang Wentang, a well-known palaeontologist and geologist, and a research professor at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology (NIGP), died in Nanjing on October 20, 2013 at 5:30PM. Prof. Zhang enjoyed a healthy old age until he passed away peacefully during a nap after lunch.

Prof. Zhang was born in Henan Province on January 10, 1925. He graduated from the Geology Department of Peking University in July 1948, and started his career as a stratigrapher and palaeontologist in the Institute of Geology of the Central Institution of Kuomintang (KMT) government. He has been a research scientist at NIGP since the establishment of NIGP in 1951, and he dedicated more than 60 years of his career to working on the Cambrian stratigraphy, trilobites and other related fields. He was a titular member of the International Subcommission on Cambrian System (ISCS) for many years, and was a member of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature based in London. He was also one of the editors of the revised trilobite volumes of the Treatise, responsible for the revision of several trilobite superfamilies.

Prof. Zhangâ€™s death is a tremendous loss of the palaeontological, stratigraphical, and geological communities in China and worldwide.

Prof. Zhang will be alive in our heart for ever.
