## ISSS Meeting 2025, Seville, Spain:
## “Advances in Silurian chronostratigraphy and high-resolution correlation”


Dates: 10th–13th September 2025

The official 2025 meeting of the International Subcommission on Silurian Stratigraphy will take place in Spain, as agreed by the delegates at the last annual meeting held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in September 2024. This year marks the 27th anniversary of the Silurian Field Meeting that took place in Spain and Portugal in June 1998, which also visited the outcrops in northern Seville. In 2025, coinciding with the meeting, the Golden Spike marking the replacement Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Telychian Stage of the Llandovery Series will be officially established there. Seville is a fitting location for a Silurian meeting due to its special significance in Spanish history, its status as a very pleasant city full of colour and tourist attractions, and, of course, its proximity to the most complete, continuous and fossiliferous Silurian sections in Spain. These sections are located in the Ossa-Morena Zone of the Iberian Massif, within the Natural Park and UNESCO Global Geopark Sierra Norte de Sevilla,
an area of great scenic, geological, and cultural value.

The Silurian rocks of Seville have attracted geological studies since the late 19th century. However, it was not until the 1970s that the discoveries of the distinguished French geologist Michel Robardet initiated a series of investigations into their exceptional stratigraphy and fossil record, making the region a model area for Silurian studies.
Seville and its Silurian strata welcome you in September 2025!

## Joint ISSS-SDS Meeting, Sofia, Bulgaria:
## “Time-line of Silurian and Devonian environmental and biotic changes”


Dates: 12–17 September 2024
Venue: Joint meeting
Website: Information about the Earth and Man National Museum is available at https://www.earthandman.org/language/en/front/, and details about the University of Mining and Geology “St. Ivan Rilski” can be found at https://mgu.bg/en/. The indoor program began with registration on September 12 at the Earth and Man National Museum (18:00–19:00), followed by a welcome party and poster session (19:00–23:00), with scientific sessions and separate ISSS and SDS business meetings occurring from September 13–15 at the University of Mining and Geology “St. Ivan Rilski.” Field excursions took place on September 16, with ISSS exploring Silurian in the Svogen Unit and SDS examining Devonian in the Moravian Unit (6–20 participants each), and on September 17, both subcommissions visited the Iskar Gorge, Western Balkan, focusing on geology, history, and culture (6–40 participants). Registration fees ranged from approximately 200 € (early bird) to 250 € (standard), covering sessions, materials, and events, while field excursions cost 50–70 € each. Abstracts and articles, submitted by June 15, 2024, were published in Geologica Balcanica (https://www.geologica-balcanica.eu/).
