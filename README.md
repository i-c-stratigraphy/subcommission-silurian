# Silurian Subcommission Website
The small website for the Silurian Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy, online at <http://silurian.stratigraphy.org>.


## Content
Content for this website is managed by the [Silurian subcommission of the ICS](https://stratigraphy.org/subcommissions#silurian).

See Contacts below.


## Technical website operations
This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) *static site generator* website which means the source files are pretty much simplified HTML pages - [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)-formatted text files - which you can see stored in the [pages/](pages/) folder. These are combined with a very simple template to add headers & footers to all pages and produce the final HTML web pages which are then delivered online with a web server. We are using the built in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This subcommission's website is hosted within the ICS's set of code repositories, see <https://github.com/i-c-stratigraphy/subcommission-silurian>.

Installing:

`bundle init`
